# Triangle Classifier

A Java application that determines the type of a triangle based on the lengths of its three sides.

## Problem Statement

Given three side lengths, classify the triangle as:
- **Equilateral**:  All three sides are equal
- **Isosceles**:  Exactly two sides are equal
- **Scalene**: All three sides are different

## Usage Examples

```
Enter the lengths of the three sides:
Side 1: 5
Side 2: 5
Side 3: 5
Result: EQUILATERAL

Enter the lengths of the three sides: 
Side 1: 5
Side 2: 5
Side 3: 7
Result: ISOSCELES

Enter the lengths of the three sides: 
Side 1: 3
Side 2: 4
Side 3: 5
Result: SCALENE
